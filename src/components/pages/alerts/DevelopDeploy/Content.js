      The Serverless Framework generates a set of pre-configured alerts from
      automatically collected data. An alerts stream helps catch
      performance issues caused by a new deployment. Just open your dashboard,
      deploy and monitor the stream. Youâ€™ll see errors and performance hits
      caused by your deployment, both immediately after the deployment, and
      later, when an issue persists.
