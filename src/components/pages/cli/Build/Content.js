      The Serverless Framework CLI is the simplest way to develop infinitely
      scalable, pay-per-execution serverless applications. A single
      configuration file allows you to list your functions and define the
      endpoints that theyâ€™re subscribed to. It provides structure, automation
      and best practices out-of-the-box, allowing you to focus on building
      sophisticated, event-driven, serverless architectures, comprised of
      functions and events.
